# React App Technical Documentation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if edits are made, and lint errors will appear in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

This command will remove the single build dependency from the project. Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into the project so that the owner has full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments.

## What is 2048?

First released online in 2014, the sliding tile video game '2048' became one of the most popular games on the web. To play, an individual player uses the arrow keys to combine slide and combine tiles together, aiming to reach 2048 before the puzzle grid fills up with tiles.

## Why recreate it?

'2048' was a class project for my first web development course (COMP 426) at UNC Chapel Hill. I chose to learn React on my own and instead of using jQuery, which was a JS library that students learned to use in the class. It was also my first time creating a "fully-fledged" game, and this was the result!

## What's next?

After finishing the project in Spring 2021, I finally uploaded it to my own GitHub repo. I plan on improving the code quality a bit more before deploying (something else I'll be learning)!

## Footnotes

I wrote the back-end game logic and front-end UI from scratch using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. I employed **React** and **Bulma** as well for front-end event handling and styling.

Cloning this repository to use for the COMP 426 project at UNC Chapel Hill is an honor code violation.
